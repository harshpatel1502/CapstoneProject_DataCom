# Network Design Project for Ethoca and Mastermind

## Overview
This project is focused on designing a secure and scalable IPv4 network infrastructure for two organizations: Ethoca and Mastermind. It incorporates modern networking practices and technologies to ensure efficient, secure, and high-performing communication between sites.

## Key Features

### 1. **Efficient IP Allocation**
- **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM):** Enables optimal utilization of IP addresses, avoiding wastage and ensuring future scalability.

### 2. **Dynamic Routing Protocols**
- **OSPF/EIGRP:** For efficient internal routing within the network.
- **eBGP:** Facilitates communication between autonomous systems.

### 3. **Network Security**
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):** Secures internal devices by hiding private IP addresses from external networks.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implements granular traffic filtering to block unauthorized access.
- **Secure Management:** Configured using encrypted protocols like SSHv2 and secure password policies.

### 4. **Quality of Service (QoS)**
- Prioritizes critical business applications to ensure consistent performance during peak network usage.

### 5. **Site-to-Site VPN**
- Establishes secure communication between Ethoca and Mastermind's locations, safeguarding sensitive data.
